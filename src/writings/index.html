        <h2>On Changes</h2>
        [draft]
        <p>So, what are you gonna do with that [degree in anthropology]?</p>
        <p>The first few times I was asked that question, uncertainty clamped me, and a mixture of anxiety shrouded me in anger, and left me no heart to appreciate the love and care of those spared no hesitation for my momentary comfort and tried to imagine my future success in a world that they thought they knew.</p>
        <p>I knew that I didn't know what I was doing. I wistfully imagined that I would just learn whatever I needed on the job, or be accepted into the Foreign Service. I resisted the professional tracks of my in-group peers, and craved freedom. I didn't get what I wanted. The price of rebellion is high, and reality is more beautiful than the plan of man.</p>
        <p>I ended up going home to Houston after graduation, tutored high schoolers for pay, lived on a ranch in Central Texas, and finally worked at a startup in DC before one fateful encounter with a USPS API pushed me towards considering computer science. Travis Breaux's name came up on the first page of Google when I searched for "anthropology and computer science," so I found his CMU email and wrote him. He replied recommending a second bachelors, and I took his advice to heart. Given my interests in capabilities and computing as a means of obtaining insight, I am happy with my choice, even with all the moments I felt out of place.</p>
        <p>The best engineers I have known learned how to code at unassuming state schools, in-between shifts as a paratrooper in Afghanistan, never having gone to college, started from modifying video games, and debugged a lot of bad code. In the words of Sihui, "if you can cook, you can code."</p>
        <p>I find education to be the output of the student as part of their development and growth. Whether you do that at a four year campus, watching YouTube, modify Excel formulas, or building your own ideas from scratch, is a personal decision. However you choose to pursue this, I have faith that you can find others to walk with you, and that if you ask for purpose, you will find it—when intrinsic motivations are greater than extrinsic ones, you ought to find joy even in small accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Reach out to me, like many others, I budget time for this.</p>

        <h2>Michelle</h2>
        <p>It was Wednesday, September 11th 2019, at least a year before most of my tech friends had experienced a full cycle of hype, I walked in to a glass-windowed conference room Joshua Tree (named after the California park), to join my coworker in front of our manager. The two manila folders on the table in front of her felt out of place for a tech company, her voice stalls, and she forces out the terminal news. Her face, and her tone betrayed her composure. This is harder on her than it was on me. She was not honest yesterday on our walk because she most definitely did not have a good weekend. I want to embrace her.</p>
        <p>The best thing about a layoff is the certainty. You know you have to look for another door. The next best thing is experiencing it with other people. After I turned in my laptop, most of us laid off holed up at a nearby coffee shop nearby; our stream of chatter stopped when my laggy work friend walked up with a banker’s box holding his three desk plants. We were paused, like in amber.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, I go on site to interview at Parabola where I met Michelle in person, their newly promoted engineering manager. A few years out of school, she gave a surprisingly practical diagramming exercise. By now warmed up with the process, this was one of my best on-sites for sure.</p>
        <p>To my surprise, I received an email from Michelle that I didn’t get an offer at Parabola, but “if you wanna talk about it, we can do a phone call.”</p>
        <p>I always ask for critical feedback while interviewing, and most conversations end here with a curt thanks. I have never seen this kind of volition volunteered. So the next morning at 9am, she tells me that I did equally well as their other final candidate, except he had 8 years of experience working on no-code tools. (Ah! I would make the same hiring decision at this stage). Most importantly, she said “I never liked the lack of feedback when I was interviewing.”</p>

        <h2>2016 Thanksgiving</h2>
        <p>Four weeks after the election, I’m still in love with my country, because of you.</p>
        <p>For years, I struggled to process the vastly different views you shared with me. At first, the impending conflict made me afraid, but your care brought me ease. Your experiences, dialogue, and principles helped me grow my world view, and knowing that we share this world strengthened my resolve.</p>
        <p>Days after the election, I saw you making yourself vulnerable, listening to and actively seeking out others who held opposing views, trying to appreciate that person’s narrative, and empathize with problems that you don’t have. You have such grace, and I’m happy to have met you.</p>
        <p>And I’m proud of your activism, even when it may appear that your actions appear small in the face of challenges. You remind me of my hero Adrian Bonenberger, who protested against the Iraq war in 2003, but chose to serve because he was angry about Abu Ghraib and believed that he could lead better.
          <a href="https://archive.is/HP1LB"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        <p>And so I am compelled to regift some words given to me.</p>
        <p>For my college commencement speaker, whose “earliest memories were Vietnam, civil rights, the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was a time of tumult, uncertainty and great change. So much so, that many wondered with the assassination of beloved leaders, the overhang of imminent nuclear war, a failing economy, troops deployed in a foreign quagmire, and the resignation of a President … if our nation would ever survive. It has survived … like every generation since independence.”
          <a href="https://almanac.upenn.edu/archive/volumes/v56/n34/comm-huntsman.html"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
        <p>We face no lesser perils.</p>
        <p>He went on to say that each generation sees “a set of circumstances that make it seem like the wheels are coming off a bus … wars, depression, social revolutions. In each case, we recover, we learn our lessons, and we become ever more resilient.”</p>
        <p>We can be more like ninety-one year old rancher grandaddy Randall, the toughest man I know.</p>
        <p>Two weeks after the election, I met a lively high schooler whose greatest concern was not about college, career, or pizza parties, but problems that could not affect her, problems in small towns away from the coasts, problems for people who are not techies, problems for people who don’t go to selective schools. Her empathy gives me not only hope but a path to overcoming our obstacles.</p>
        <p>I spent November 8th volunteering at a neighborhood poll in San Francisco, and I not only met incredible volunteers, but saw a relentless drive from the poll inspector to ensure the numbers were right. The hundreds of sincere voters that day left with my trust and left me interested in them.</p>
        <p>Which is how I felt about you. In lieu of studying abroad in college, I wanted to spend more time learning about my fellow Americans, you. This is why I took a seemingly random selection of liberal arts classes, and this is why I lived on a ranch in Americana, all because a Times For Kids article I read in the 5th grade spoke of small towns where you don’t lock your doors at night. Six years after graduation, and many cities and communities later, the most important thing I have learned is that the vast majority of people I have met are made of earth, like you.</p>
        <p>I know that you have endured great pain and my experience prevents me from fully understanding what you have gone through, but you can bet your last nickel that I’d listen.</p>
        <p>Dialogue is my solution.</p>
        <p>To end on a lighter note, enjoy this quote misattributed to Churchill, “you can always count on the Americans to do the right thing after they have tried everything else.”</p>
        <p>I love you and miss you this holiday season.</p>
