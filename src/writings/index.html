        <h2>On Changes</h2>
        <p>"So, what are you going to do with that [degree in anthropology]?"</p>
        <p>I didn't know.</p>
        <p>I lament that I responded the first handful of times with a lack of grace. There was anxiety behind a self-directed anger and a timelessness in care from those who spared no hesitation for my momentary comfort and tried to fit my future success into their world view.</p>
        <p>From the life experience of my theory professor, I knew I wasn't suited for academia. I thought about getting into the Foreign Service and learn everything on the job. Maybe that affirmation was the only path I could accept, unique, and worthy of having made unconventional choices. The consulting, law school, and banking paths of my peers felt well-defined. I detested having to live someone else's story.</p>
        <p>I ended up going home to Houston after graduation in 2010, and tutored high schoolers for pay before working on a ranch in Central Texas which coincidentally grounded me. I accepted an internship at a startup in DC because I had limited options, but there I appreciated the utility of being able to just make API calls. I searched for "anthropology and computer science," and found likely the only person with this combination on the first page of results (Google was good in 2012), Travis Breaux, professor at CMU. Great, I send him an email there, and he replied right away. He explained his path of getting a second bachelors, and I took his advice. I felt out of place in Dallas and behind my peers, but having a goal gave me clarity, and I found my way to San Francisco in 2016.</p>
        <p>Over the five years I spent worshipping at software Mecca, the best engineers I met learned how to code at unassuming state schools, in-between shifts as a paratrooper in Afghanistan, didn't go to college, started with editing their video games, and debugged a lot of bad code by
          <code>console.logging</code>. It is clear by 2025 that we mystified skills, and undervalued determination. In the words of my friend Sihui<a href="https://www.sihui.io/from-hello-world-to-facebook-airbnb-salesforce/"><sup>1</sup></a>, "if you can cook, you can code." The same experience can hold true in future changes.</p>

        <h2>Michelle</h2>
        <p>It was Wednesday, September 11th 2019, at least a year before most of my tech friends had experienced a full hype cycle in its depth, I walked in to the glass-windowed conference room Joshua Tree (named after the California park) to join an impromptu meeting with a coworker and our manager when I see two manila folders on the table in front of her that felt out of place at a tech company. Her voice stalls. She forces out terminal news. Her face, and her tone began to betray her composure, and I came to realize that this was harder on her than it was on me. She was dishonest yesterday on our walk−she most definitely did not have a good weekend. I, I want to embrace her.</p>
        <p>The best thing about a layoff is the certainty. You know you have to look for another door. The next best thing is experiencing it with other people. After I turned in my laptop, most of us laid off holed up at a nearby coffee shop nearby; our stream of chatter stopped when my laggy work friend walked up with a banker’s box containing his three desk plants. We paused, like in amber, but Tom moved like a Harry Potter photo.</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, I have rebooted my interview process, and go on site to interview at Parabola, a no-code software platform tool. Michelle, their newly promoted engineering manager, greets me and gives their design exercise. She was just a few years out of school, and I could tell that she was a first-time manager, but I think I liked them. Now warmed up with interviewing, this was one of my best on-sites yet.</p>
        <p>To my surprise, I received an email from Michelle that I didn’t get an offer from Parabola, but “if you wanna talk about it, we can do a phone call.”</p>
        <p>As a habitual asker for critical feedback, most rejections signal the end of a conversation. Teams scurry on to their next tasks, and feedback is silent and lawsuit proof. I had never seen this kind of volition. So the next morning at 9am, she tells me that I did equally well as their other final candidate, except he had 8 years of experience working on no-code tools. (Ah! I would make the same hiring decision at this stage). But most importantly, “I never liked the lack of feedback when I was interviewing,” she said.</p>
        <p>Michelle.</p>

        <h2>2016 After Election Thanksgiving<a href="https://www.facebook.com/xizhang11/posts/pfbid02Si8PxEtuVcdGEn9N57iGudBE2ekpxGCmhWQKMFgDTmnoi4HEsrLndduiw5zBhu9Bl"><sup>*</sup></a></h2>
        <p>Four weeks after the election, I’m still in love with my country, because of you.</p>
        <p>For years, I struggled to process the vastly different views you shared with me. At first, the impending conflict made me afraid, but your care brought me ease. Your experiences, dialogue, and principles helped me grow my world view, and knowing that we share this world strengthened my resolve.</p>
        <p>Days after the election, I saw you making yourself vulnerable, listening to and actively seeking out others who held opposing views, trying to appreciate that person’s narrative, and empathize with problems that you don’t have. You have such grace, and I’m happy to have met you.</p>
        <p>And I’m proud of your activism, even when it may appear that your actions appear small in the face of challenges. You remind me of my hero Adrian Bonenberger, who protested against the Iraq war in 2003, but chose to serve because he was angry about Abu Ghraib and believed that he could lead better.
          <a href="https://archive.is/HP1LB"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        <p>And so I am compelled to regift some words given to me.</p>
        <p>For my college commencement speaker, whose “earliest memories were Vietnam, civil rights, the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show. It was a time of tumult, uncertainty and great change. So much so, that many wondered with the assassination of beloved leaders, the overhang of imminent nuclear war, a failing economy, troops deployed in a foreign quagmire, and the resignation of a President … if our nation would ever survive. It has survived … like every generation since independence.”
          <a href="https://almanac.upenn.edu/archive/volumes/v56/n34/comm-huntsman.html"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
        <p>We face no lesser perils.</p>
        <p>He went on to say that each generation sees “a set of circumstances that make it seem like the wheels are coming off a bus … wars, depression, social revolutions. In each case, we recover, we learn our lessons, and we become ever more resilient.”</p>
        <p>We can be more like ninety-one year old rancher grandaddy Randall, the toughest man I know.</p>
        <p>Two weeks after the election, I met a lively high schooler whose greatest concern was not about college, career, or pizza parties, but problems that could not affect her, problems in small towns away from the coasts, problems for people who are not techies, problems for people who don’t go to selective schools. Her empathy gives me not only hope but a path to overcoming our obstacles.</p>
        <p>I spent November 8th volunteering at a neighborhood poll in San Francisco, and I not only met incredible volunteers, but saw a relentless drive from the poll inspector to ensure the numbers were right. The hundreds of sincere voters that day left with my trust and left me interested in them.</p>
        <p>Which is how I felt about you. In lieu of studying abroad in college, I wanted to spend more time learning about my fellow Americans, you. This is why I took a seemingly random selection of liberal arts classes, and this is why I lived on a ranch in Americana, all because a Times For Kids article I read in the 5th grade spoke of small towns where you don’t lock your doors at night. Six years after graduation, and many cities and communities later, the most important thing I have learned is that the vast majority of people I have met are made of earth, like you.</p>
        <p>I know that you have endured great pain and my experience prevents me from fully understanding what you have gone through, but you can bet your last nickel that I’d listen.</p>
        <p>Dialogue is my solution.</p>
        <p>To end on a lighter note, enjoy this quote misattributed to Churchill, “you can always count on the Americans to do the right thing after they have tried everything else.”</p>
        <p>I love you and miss you this holiday season.</p>
