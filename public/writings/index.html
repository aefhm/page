              So, what are you gonna do with that [degree in anthropology]?
            </p>

            <p>
              The first few times I was asked that question, uncertainty clamped me, and a mixture of anxiety shrouded
              me in anger, and left me no heart to appreciate the love and care of those spared no hesitation for my
              momentary comfort and tried to imagine my future success in a world that they thought they knew.
            </p>

            <p>
              I knew that I didn't know what I was doing. I wistfully imagined that I would just learn whatever I
              needed on the job, or be accepted into the Foreign Service. I resisted the professional tracks of my
              in-group peers, and craved freedom. I didn't get what I wanted. The price of rebellion is high, and
              reality is more beautiful than the plan of man.
            </p>

            <p>
              I ended up going home to Houston after graduation, tutored high schoolers for pay, lived on a ranch in
              Central Texas, and finally worked at a startup in DC before one fateful encounter with a USPS API pushed
              me towards considering computer science. Travis Breaux's name came up on the first page of Google when I
              searched for "anthropology and computer science," so I found his CMU email and wrote him. He replied
              recommending a second bachelors, and I took his advice to heart. Given my interests in capabilities and
              computing as a means of obtaining insight, I am happy with my choice, even with all the moments I felt
              out of place.
            </p>

            <p>
              The best engineers I have known learned how to code at unassuming state schools, in-between shifts as a
              paratrooper in Afghanistan, never having gone to college, started from modifying video games, and
              debugged a lot of bad code. In the words of Sihui, "if you can cook, you can code."
            </p>

            <p>
              I find education to be the output of the student as part of their development and growth. Whether you do
              that at a four year campus, watching YouTube, modify Excel formulas, or building your own ideas from
              scratch, is a personal decision. However you choose to pursue this, I have faith that you can find others
              to walk with you, and that if you ask for purpose, you will find it‚Äîwhen intrinsic motivations are
              greater than extrinsic ones, you ought to find joy even in small accomplishments.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reach out to me, like many others, I budget time for this.

            <p>
              In 2019, at least a year before most of my tech friends had experienced a full cycle of hype, I walked in
              to a glassy conference room (Joshua Tree, named after national parks), to sit with my coworker in front
              of our manager. The two manila folders in front of her felt out of place for a tech company, her voice
              stalls and forces out the news. Aww, poor girl. This is harder on her than it was on me. She most
              definitely did not have a good weekend. She was not honest on Monday. I want to hug her.
            </p>

            <p>
              The best thing about a layoff is the certainty. You know you have to look for another door. The next best
              thing is experiencing it with other people. A group of us holed up at a nearby coffee shop after hearing
              the news, and the image of my laggard work friend walking up with a banker‚Äôs box carrying his three
              favorite plants is in my memory like amber.
            </p>

            <p>
              A few weeks later, I go on-site to interview at Parabola where I meet Michelle, their newly promoted
              engineering manager.
            </p>

            <p>
              Soon, I received an email from Michelle that I didn‚Äôt get an offer at Parabola, but ‚Äúif you wanna talk
              about it, we can do a phone call.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
              I always ask for critical feedback while interviewing, and had never seen this kind of volition. So the
              next morning at 9am, she tells me that I did equally well as their other final candidate, except he had 8
              years of experience working on no-code tools. (Ah! I would make the same hiring call at this stage). More
              importantly, she said ‚ÄúI never liked the lack of feedback when I was interviewing.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
              Michelle.
