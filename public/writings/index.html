              So, what are you gonna do with that [degree in anthropology]?
            </p>

            <p>
              The first few times I was asked that question, uncertainty clamped me, and a mixture of anxiety shrouded
              me in anger, and left me no heart to appreciate the love and care of those spared no hesitation for my
              momentary comfort and tried to imagine my future success in a world that they thought they knew.
            </p>

            <p>
              I knew that I didn't know what I was doing. I wistfully imagined that I would just learn whatever I
              needed on the job, or be accepted into the Foreign Service. I resisted the professional tracks of my
              in-group peers, and craved freedom. I didn't get what I wanted. The price of rebellion is high, and
              reality is more beautiful than the plan of man.
            </p>

            <p>
              I ended up going home to Houston after graduation, tutored high schoolers for pay, lived on a ranch in
              Central Texas, and finally worked at a startup in DC before one fateful encounter with a USPS API pushed
              me towards considering computer science. Travis Breaux's name came up on the first page of Google when I
              searched for "anthropology and computer science," so I found his CMU email and wrote him. He replied
              recommending a second bachelors, and I took his advice to heart. Given my interests in capabilities and
              computing as a means of obtaining insight, I am happy with my choice, even with all the moments I felt
              out of place.
            </p>

            <p>
              The best engineers I have known learned how to code at unassuming state schools, in-between shifts as a
              paratrooper in Afghanistan, never having gone to college, started from modifying video games, and
              debugged a lot of bad code. In the words of Sihui, "if you can cook, you can code."
            </p>

            <p>
              I find education to be the output of the student as part of their development and growth. Whether you do
              that at a four year campus, watching YouTube, modify Excel formulas, or building your own ideas from
              scratch, is a personal decision. However you choose to pursue this, I have faith that you can find others
              to walk with you, and that if you ask for purpose, you will find it‚Äîwhen intrinsic motivations are
              greater than extrinsic ones, you ought to find joy even in small accomplishments.
            </p>

            <p>
              Reach out to me, like many others, I budget time for this.

            <h2>
              Michelle
            </h2>

            <p>
              In 2019, at least a year before most of my tech friends had experienced a full cycle of hype, I walked in
              to a glassy conference room (Joshua Tree, named after national parks), to sit with my coworker in front
              of our manager. The two manila folders in front of her felt out of place for a tech company, her voice
              stalls and forces out the news. Aww, poor girl. This is harder on her than it was on me. She most
              definitely did not have a good weekend. She was not honest on Monday. I want to hug her.
            </p>

            <p>
              The best thing about a layoff is the certainty. You know you have to look for another door. The next best
              thing is experiencing it with other people. A group of us holed up at a nearby coffee shop after hearing
              the news, and the image of my laggard work friend walking up with a banker‚Äôs box carrying his three
              favorite plants is in my memory like amber.
            </p>

            <p>
              A few weeks later, I go on-site to interview at Parabola where I meet Michelle, their newly promoted
              engineering manager. A few years out of school, she gave a surprisingly practical diagramming exercise.
              This was one of my best on-sites for sure.
            </p>

            <p>
              Soon, I received an email from Michelle that I didn‚Äôt get an offer at Parabola, but ‚Äúif you wanna talk
              about it, we can do a phone call.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
              I always ask for critical feedback while interviewing, and had never seen this kind of volition. So the
              next morning at 9am, she tells me that I did equally well as their other final candidate, except he had 8
              years of experience working on no-code tools. (Ah! I would make the same hiring call at this stage). More
              importantly, she said ‚ÄúI never liked the lack of feedback when I was interviewing.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
              Michelle.

              2016 Thanksgiving
            </h2>

            <p>
              Four weeks after the election, I‚Äôm still in love with my country, because of you.
            </p>

            <p>
              For years, I struggled to process the vastly different views you shared with me. At first, the impending
              conflict made me afraid, but your care brought me ease. Your experiences, dialogue, and principles helped
              me grow my world view, and knowing that we share this world strengthened my resolve.
            </p>

            <p>
              Days after the election, I saw you making yourself vulnerable, listening to and actively seeking out
              others who held opposing views, trying to appreciate that person‚Äôs narrative, and empathize with problems
              that you don‚Äôt have. You have such grace, and I‚Äôm happy to have met you.
            </p>

            <p>
              And I‚Äôm proud of your activism, even when it may appear that your actions appear small in the face of
              challenges. You remind me of my hero Adrian Bonenberger, who protested against the Iraq war in 2003, but
              chose to serve because he was angry about Abu Ghraib and believed that he could lead better. <a href=
              "https://archive.is/HP1LB"><sup>1</sup></a>
            </p>

            <p>
              And so I am compelled to regift some words given to me.
            </p>

            <p>
              For my college commencement speaker, whose ‚Äúearliest memories were Vietnam, civil rights, the Beatles on
              the Ed Sullivan Show. It was a time of tumult, uncertainty and great change. So much so, that many
              wondered with the assassination of beloved leaders, the overhang of imminent nuclear war, a failing
              economy, troops deployed in a foreign quagmire, and the resignation of a President ‚Ä¶ if our nation would
              ever survive. It has survived ‚Ä¶ like every generation since independence.‚Äù <a href=
              "https://almanac.upenn.edu/archive/volumes/v56/n34/comm-huntsman.html"><sup>2</sup></a>
            </p>

            <p>
              We face no lesser perils.
            </p>

            <p>
              He went on to say that each generation sees ‚Äúa set of circumstances that make it seem like the wheels are
              coming off a bus ‚Ä¶ wars, depression, social revolutions. In each case, we recover, we learn our lessons,
              and we become ever more resilient.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
              We can be more like ninety-one year old rancher grandaddy Randall, the toughest man I know.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two weeks after the election, I met a lively high schooler whose greatest concern was not about college,
              career, or pizza parties, but problems that could not affect her, problems in small towns away from the
              coasts, problems for people who are not techies, problems for people who don‚Äôt go to selective schools.
              Her empathy gives me not only hope but a path to overcoming our obstacles.
            </p>

            <p>
              I spent November 8th volunteering at a neighborhood poll in San Francisco, and I not only met incredible
              volunteers, but saw a relentless drive from the poll inspector to ensure the numbers were right. The
              hundreds of sincere voters that day left with my trust and left me interested in them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Which is how I felt about you. In lieu of studying abroad in college, I wanted to spend more time
              learning about my fellow Americans, you. This is why I took a seemingly random selection of liberal arts
              classes, and this is why I lived on a ranch in Americana, all because a Times For Kids article I read in
              the 5th grade spoke of small towns where you don‚Äôt lock your doors at night. Six years after graduation,
              and many cities and communities later, the most important thing I have learned is that the vast majority
              of people I have met are made of earth, like you.
            </p>

            <p>
              I know that you have endured great pain and my experience prevents me from fully understanding what you
              have gone through, but you can bet your last nickel that I‚Äôd listen.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dialogue is my solution.
            </p>

            <p>
              To end on a lighter note, enjoy this quote misattributed to Churchill, ‚Äúyou can always count on the
              Americans to do the right thing after they have tried everything else.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
              I love you and miss you this holiday season.
